# Exercises

I've chosen to take on various common programming exercise in perl in order to
better understand and practice with the language. I'm not depending on a single
source for these exercises and instead am choosing to just pick challanges that
are prototypical to any programing language. For example, the first two
challanges I've chosen are `FizzBuzz` and `Binary Search`.
